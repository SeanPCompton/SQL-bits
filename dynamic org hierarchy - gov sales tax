/*
Recursive Query (WITH RECURSIVE):

Builds the organizational hierarchy dynamically.
Starts with employees who have no manager (ManagerID IS NULL) and recursively finds their direct reports.
Dynamic Hierarchy Path:

Constructs a HierarchyPath to track the chain of command.
For example: 1 > 3 > 7 represents Employee 7 reporting to Employee 3, who reports to Employee 1.
Hierarchical Level Calculation:

The Level column indicates the depth of the employee in the hierarchy, starting from 0 (top-level manager).
Departmental Integration:

Joins the Departments table to enrich the data with department and regional information.
Ordering:

Orders results by HierarchyPath to ensure proper hierarchical visualization.
